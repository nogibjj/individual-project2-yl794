# Week8 mini project 

This project focuses on the comparation between python script and rust script. i read a csv file and calculate median number, then the performance between rust and python script are shown in the result.

## Challenge Exercises (Optional):

1. Enhance the transformation phase by joining the data with another dataset, aggregating by specific categories, or normalizing columns.
2. Identify and display correlated fields in the data using SQL queries.
3. Create a secondary table in the SQLite database and demonstrate a join operation between the two tables.
4. Implement a Flask web application that executes queries upon request and showcases the results.
5. Containerize the application with Docker for better portability.

## Requirements:

- Python
- Rust
- Panda

## Getting Started:

To get started with this project:

1. run python3 main.py to get the result from python script.
2. run cargo run to read config and dependencies in Cargo.toml file and build a cargo file.
3. enter src folder and run cargo run to get result from rust script.

## Result
Here is the result for python script:
